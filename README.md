# freeCodeCamp
A repository of all my completed freeCodeCamp challenges and projects.<br>
Links for each individual project will be placed here, as well as a list of the resources, languages, and concepts learned. <br>
Please keep in mind that they do get better overtime as I learn more and try new things, so keep that in mind, and note the original completion date.

### Front End Development
  - **Tic Tac Toe** - _Mar 21, 2018_<br/>
 A implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with multiple settings. It allows for Player vs. Player (with names, colours, and shape selection) and Player vs. AI (with everything else, and AI difficulty settings). One of the difficulty settings is 'Impossible' which uses the minimax algorithm for an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI.<br/>
 Concepts: **HTML5 w/ Haml**, **CSS3 w/ Bootstrap & SCSS**, **JS w/ JQuery & AI Algorithm Logic**<br/>

  - **Simon Game** - _Mar 15, 2018_<br/>
 A recreation of the famous toy which calls on the user's memory of a sequence of button presses in order to win. A few additonal features have been added, such as strict-mode, spin-mode, no-repeat mode and multiple colour schemes.<br/>
 Concepts: **HTML5 w/ Haml**, **CSS3 w/ Bootstrap & SCSS**, **JS w/ JQuery & Web Audio API**<br/>

 - **Pomodoro Clock** - _Mar 12, 2018_<br/>
 A timer using the pomodoro productivity technique, of set break and work timers to regiment time spent allocated to tasks.It is styled as a fuel gauge which empties and refills on work periods and break periods respectively.<br/>
 Concepts: **HTML5 w/ Haml**, **CSS3 w/ Bootstrap & SCSS**, **JS w/ JQuery**<br/>

 - **JavaScript Calculator** - _Mar 06, 2018_<br/>
 A calculator app that runs entirely on complex hand-coded JavaScript. It is meant to be a desktop calculator which ignores BEDMAS so performs operations linearly. It scales responsively for mobile and does not implore the 300ms delay, allowing for faster inputs.<br/>
 Concepts: **HTML5 w/ Haml**, **CSS3 w/ Bootstrap & SCSS**, **JS w/ JQuery**<br/>

 - **Advanced Algorithm Scripting** - _Feb 22, 2018_<br/>
 A set of mid-level algorithms for manipulating strings, numbers and arrays, similar to a higher skills technical interview. These algorithms were fairly complex and involved advanced concepts.<br/>
 Concepts: **Pure JS**<br/>
 Link: 
 - **Intermediate Algorithm Scripting** - _Feb 17, 2018_<br/>
 A set of decent algorithms for manipulating strings, numbers, arrays and objects, similar to real technical interview prep. These algorithms were a good middle ground between difficult and accessible.<br/>
 Concepts: **Pure JS**<br/>

 - **Twitch.tv Stream Client** - _Feb 15, 2018_<br/>
 A webpage with an array of Twitch.tv streamers which accesses the Twitch.tv API through FCC's glitch.me and displays information about the streamer's current status and profile. There are also filters/sorts which dynamically affect the data shown.<br/>
 Concepts: **HTML5 w/ Haml**, **CSS3 w/ Bootstrap & SCSS**, **JS w/ JQuery & JSON APIs**<br/>

 - **Random Quote Machine** - _Feb 04, 2018_<br/>
 A webpage styled as a mobile phone with the Tinder app open that cycles through different lame pick-up lines, names, locations, and background images.<br/>
 Concepts: **HTML5**, **CSS3 w/ Bootstrap & SCSS**, **JS w/ JQuery** <br/>
 Link: <https://leeandher.github.io/projects/quotes/>
 - **Basic Algorithm Scripting** - _Jan 31, 2018_<br/>
 A set of basic algorithms for manipulating strings, numbers and arrays, similar to basic technical interview prep.<br/>
 Concepts: **Pure JS**<br/>
 Link: <https://leeandher.github.io/freeCodeCamp/Front End Development Projects/basic-algorithms.js>
 - **Personal Portfolio** - _Jan 28, 2018_<br/>
 A portfolio page split up into sections with page navigation, filled with self-depricating jokes and a cool colour scheme. <br/>
 Concepts: **HTML5**, **CSS3 w/ Bootstrap**, **Basic JS w/ Basic JQuery**<br/>
